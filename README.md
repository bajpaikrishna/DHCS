# Dynamic Hierarchical Cooperative Swarm Algorithm (DHCS)

## Overview

The **Dynamic Hierarchical Cooperative Swarm Algorithm (DHCS)** is a novel optimization technique inspired by swarm intelligence. The algorithm involves agents that adapt their roles dynamically to balance exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional optimization landscapes. The agents cooperate by forming clusters, sharing solutions, and periodically synchronizing to avoid stagnation.

This approach is particularly effective for solving complex optimization problems such as the **Ackley function**.

## Features

- **Dynamic Agent Roles**: Agents take on different roles such as explorers, refiners, and leaders based on their performance.
- **Memory Sharing**: Agents maintain and share high-quality solutions to improve convergence.
- **Dynamic Clustering**: Agents form clusters based on proximity and fitness, with cluster leaders guiding others.
- **Synchronization**: Periodic synchronization of agentsâ€™ positions and velocities to prevent divergence.

## Algorithm Details

1. **Agent Behavior**: Agents explore, exploit, and lead other agents to find optimal solutions.
2. **Memory and Role Adaptation**: Agents store their best-found solutions and adapt their roles based on fitness improvement.
3. **Cluster Formation**: Agents are grouped based on proximity and fitness, with the best agent becoming a leader.
4. **Synchronization**: Agents are synchronized if no significant improvement occurs for a set number of iterations.

## Requirements

To run this algorithm, the following Python packages are required:

- `numpy` (for numerical operations)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting the convergence history)
- `random` (for generating random values)
- `time` (for measuring execution time)

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
request code over email at email address bajpaikrishna715@gmail.com
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd DHCS
```

3. Run the algorithm:

```bash
python dhcs_algorithm.py
```

The script will execute the **DHCS** algorithm using the Ackley function as the optimization benchmark. You will see the convergence history printed in the terminal, and a plot of the global best fitness over iterations will be displayed.
